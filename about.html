        actively organized and conducted by prestigious colleges of University of
        Delhi and other prominent institutions. These events give a teaser to these
        young folks about how the trading and business world functions and at the
        same time, boost their business awareness. Validating all these factors, a
        specialized and professional body was set up in the School as COMSOC,
        providing this opportunity to its future entrepreneurs and managers.</h2>
